            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi my name is Min! I like cooking, basketball, and movies! I am originally from the
                    Bay Area, and I moved to Seattle in March of 2020. 
                </p>
            <h2>My Education<h2></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I graduated in 2019 from UC Santa Barbara</li>
                    <li>I graduated from Heritage High School in 2015</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>My Work Experience</h2>
                <p>After college, I worked as a researcher at Seattle Children's Research Institute. 
                    My last research project focused on infant brain development, specifically looking
                    for biomarkers for potential developmental disorders.</p>
            <h2>My Goals</h2>
                <p>My goal is to ultimately receive my certificate for advanced software development in python,
                    and then break into the tech field as a software developer. I did a bit of coding here and there
                    at my old job and I realized just how much I really enjoyed it. I was always curious about entering
                    tech and the timing lined up perfectly for me to join Code Fellows. 
                </p>
